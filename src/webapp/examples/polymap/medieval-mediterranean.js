			"Text" :          "The opposing party constantly urged the signoria to punish the Donati, for in this meeting in Santa Trinita they had contravened the Ordinances of Justice by making a conspiracy and a plot against the government. In investigating the truth of this conspiracy, it was discovered that the Count of Battifolle had sent his son with his armed followers at the request of the conspirators. And letters were found in which messer Simone de\' Bardi had written that he would have a great quantity of bread baked, so that the men who were coming would have enough to eat. This clearly proved that a conspiracy was arranged at that meeting in Santa Trinita, for which the Count and his son and messer Simone were sentenced to heavy penalties. Now that the hatred and ill will of both factions were out in the open, each group strove to harm the other. But in their harsh words the Donati revealed themselves much more brazenly than the Cerchi, and they feared nothing.\" Dino Compagni\'s Chronicle of Florence, 27-28",
