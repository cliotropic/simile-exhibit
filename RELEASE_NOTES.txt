Version 2.2.0 -- March 10, 2009

- Fixed bug in database.getAllItems() that causes 4 function members of Array 
  to be counted in the returned set.
  
- Fixed bug in lens template generator that caused a TBODY to be returned if
  the template starts with a TR root node. This previously caused the rowStyler
  function in any tabular view that includes a row template to get a TBODY
  instead of a TR. 
  
- Added localization files for locale "nl", contributed by Marko.

- Moved extensions directory inside api directory.

- Fixed bug where hierarchical facet breaks when the result set is empty.

- Linked to api.simile-widgets.org/ajax/2.2.1/.

- Updated presidents example to include Obama. Added a few computed columns to the table view.
  Removed extraneous files.
  
- Linked timeplot extension to timeplot 1.1 on api.simile-widgets.org. Also bundled the extension.

- Linked to http://service.simile-widgets.org/ for painter and babel services.


Version 2.1.0 -- November 16, 2008

- Fixed bug on IE 8 caused by element.getAttribute() as used in Exhibit.getAttribute() 
  returning an empty string rather than null as in previous versions of IE. This
  bug caused all exhibits using Exhibit 2.0 to break on IE 8.

- Switched over to using SimileAjax 2.1.0.
  
- Switched over to using Timeline 2.2.0.
