RELEASE_NOTES.txt

Ongoing

- Fixed bug in "or" function.
- Added the "compilations" to the build process in order to support dynamic loading.
- Added an example to illustrate dynamic loading.
- Implemented paging in Tile, Thumbnail, and Tabular views. New settings include: 
  paginate = true or false; default is false
  pageSize = items per page; default is 20
  page = starting page index, from 0
  pageWindow = number of pages before and after current page to show 
    if the current page is far from the first page and/or the last page;
    default is 2
- Support columnCount setting for thumbnail view.
- Added support for polygons and polylines in map view, and added an example called 
  polymap to illustrate these features.
- Added scrollWheelZoom setting for map view.
- Compilations don't seem to be a good thing so they are removed for the time being.
  We might experiment with a server-side solution instead.

Version 2.2.0 -- March 10, 2009

- Fixed bug in database.getAllItems() that causes 4 function members of Array 
  to be counted in the returned set.
  
- Fixed bug in lens template generator that caused a TBODY to be returned if
  the template starts with a TR root node. This previously caused the rowStyler
  function in any tabular view that includes a row template to get a TBODY
  instead of a TR. 
  
- Added localization files for locale "nl", contributed by Marko.

- Moved extensions directory inside api directory.

- Fixed bug where hierarchical facet breaks when the result set is empty.

- Linked to api.simile-widgets.org/ajax/2.2.1/.

- Upgraded Timeline to 2.3.1.

- Updated presidents example to include Obama. Added a few computed columns to the table view.
  Removed extraneous files.
  
- Linked timeplot extension to timeplot 1.1 on api.simile-widgets.org. Also bundled the extension.

- Linked to http://service.simile-widgets.org/ for painter and babel services.


Version 2.1.0 -- November 16, 2008

- Fixed bug on IE 8 caused by element.getAttribute() as used in Exhibit.getAttribute() 
  returning an empty string rather than null as in previous versions of IE. This
  bug caused all exhibits using Exhibit 2.0 to break on IE 8.

- Switched over to using SimileAjax 2.1.0.
  
- Switched over to using Timeline 2.2.0.

- Performance enhancements related to collapsed facet calculation (by eob).

- Curate extension (by sbostler).
